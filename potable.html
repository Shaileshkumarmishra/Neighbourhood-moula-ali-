        <h2>Potable Water </h2>
        <p>
            In Moula Ali, residents have access to Manjeera water every alternate day for 2 hours. However,
             in some areas like Kasturi Nagar, near Moula Ali junction, the limited provision of Manjeera water 
             poses a significant issue. In this locality, the municipality offers water for a mere 3-hour duration,
              but only once every 4-5 days, which creates water scarcity problems for the residents.<br><br>
Some people utilize filtration methods to address their water quality needs.
Rainwater harvesting is actively practiced in certain areas, particularly in apartment buildings. The residents are well-informed about the benefits of this sustainableÂ practice.
